- Improved scalability and reliability

### **Layer 3: Central Guardian Server** (Enhanced from our design)
```
🧩 Central Guardian Server (Node.js / Go)
- Registers Agents
- Manages MCP flow  
- Dispatches tools
- Detects anomalies
- Balances workloads
```

**Status:** ✅ This matches our Phase 1 Guardian design but with enhanced capabilities

### **Layer 4: Modular Toolset** (NEW - Addresses Cisco Phase 2-4)
```
🔧 Modular Toolset (Docker)
├── Tool A: Anomaly Detector (scikit-learn/PyCaret)
├── Tool B: Tetragon Parser (eBPF/Tetragon + Python)  
└── Tool C: Remediation Bot (Bash/Ansible scripts)
```

**This Addresses:**
- ✅ **Cisco Phase 2**: Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
- ✅ **Cisco Phase 3**: Threat identification and prediction
- ✅ **Cisco Phase 4**: Automated remediation actions

### **Layer 5: Graph Database** (NEW - Advanced Enhancement)
```
🧠 Graph Database - Neo4j
- Nodes = agents/endpoints
- Edges = connections, data flows
- Properties = CPU, mem, status, anomalies
```

**Why This is Powerful:**
- **Visual network mapping** - See relationships between all agents
- **Graph reasoning** - Understand how threats spread through network
- **Pattern detection** - Identify unusual connection patterns
- **Intuitive visualization** - Perfect for demos and presentations

### **Layer 6: LLM Decision Layer** (NEW - AI Intelligence)
```
🤖 LLM Decision Layer (Gemini 2.0 / Claude)
- Queries GraphDB + Tool results
- Explains decisions in natural language
- Helps Guardian choose next best action
```

**Revolutionary Features:**
- **Explainable AI** - System explains its decisions in plain English
- **Intelligent recommendations** - AI suggests best response actions
- **Natural language interface** - Security teams can ask questions in normal language
- **Learning system** - Gets smarter over time

### **Layer 7: Live Dashboard** (Enhanced from our design)
```
📊 Live Dashboard (React + Tailwind)
- Live endpoint health + threat graph
- Logs, status, flow maps (D3.js)
- Chat pane powered by Gemini
```

**This Addresses:**
- ✅ **Cisco Phase 6**: Interactive dashboard with LLM integration
- ✅ **Real-time visualization** of network topology
- ✅ **Chat interface** for natural language queries
