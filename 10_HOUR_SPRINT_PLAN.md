```
✅ Live agent status visualization
✅ Real-time threat detection and alerts  
✅ Automated response actions with visual confirmation
✅ Network topology showing agent communication

## ⚠️ **Risk Mitigation for 10-Hour Sprint**

### **Technical Risks:**
```
🎯 WebSocket connection issues
Solution: Simple reconnection logic + fallback to polling

🎯 React rendering performance with real-time data
Solution: Debouncing updates + virtualization for large lists

🎯 LLM API rate limits or failures  
Solution: Pre-generated responses + caching + graceful degradation

🎯 Multi-process agent simulation complexity
Solution: Single-process simulation with threading if needed
```

### **Demo Risks:**
```
🎯 Live demo technical failure
Solution: Pre-recorded backup demo + local-only deployment
